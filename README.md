# Detecting-Parkinsons-Disease
We have learned how to detect the Parkinson's Disease in people with different factors in this Python machine learning project. We have used an XGBClassifier to produce the dataset and have used the sklearn library. That gives a 94.87 percent accuracy, which is very important in view of the number of code lines in this python project.
